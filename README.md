# influx_nut

I am archiving this repo as I no longer use it, and the project it was forked from is also archived so I can't merge it. The differences from the project it was forked from are twofold. Firstly, the change from just collections to collections.abc improved support for newer version of Python. Secondly, changes to a split() action were made to add support for spaces in UPS status values.


An interface between Network UPS Tools and influxdb.

This allows sending metrics from NUT to an influxdb database.

## Getting started

```
# cd /path/to/git/clone
# pip3 install .
# cp config.example.json /etc/influx_nut.json  # edit to set up for your needs
$ influx_nut --config /etc/influx_nut.json
```

## Example configuration

### UPS load and voltage reporting

```json
{
  "nut_host": "nutcase",
  "nut_ups": "cp1500avr",
  "nut_vars": {
    "ups.load": {"type": "int", "measurement_name": "ups_load"},
    "input.voltage": {"type": "float", "measurement_name": "ups_voltage"}
  },
  "influx_host": "http://influxbox:8086",
  "influx_creds": ["user", "lamepassword"],
  "influx_db": "systems",
  "influx_tags": {
    "ups": "cp1500avr"
  }
}
```

### Config documentation

#### `interval`

How frequently is the data sent to Influx in seconds? Default: `20`.

#### `nut_host`

Hostname NUT is accessible at. Default: `"127.0.0.1"`.

#### `nut_port`

Port number to use to connect to the NUT server. Default: `3493`.

#### `nut_ups`

UPS name on that NUT server. Default: `"ups1"`.

#### `nut_vars`

Variables to send from NUT to influxdb. Example:

```json
"nut_vars": {
  "ups.realpower.nominal": {
     "type": "int",
     "measurement_name": "ups1_power"
  }
}
```

Valid types are "float", "int", "bool", and "str".

#### `influx_host`

URL of influxdb server to send data to, without a trailing slash.
Default: `"http://127.0.0.1:8086"`.

#### `influx_db`

Database on the influxdb server to put data in. Default: `"systems"`.

#### `influx_tags`

Tags (in mapping form) to send to the influxdb server. These are static for
all measurements sent from influx_nut.
Example:

```json
{"tag1": "value1", "tag2": "value2"}
```

#### `influx_creds`

Credentials to use to connect to the influxdb server. Example: `["user", "sekrit"]`.
Default is `null` (no authentication).
